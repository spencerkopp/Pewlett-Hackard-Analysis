# Pewlett-Hackard Analysis

## Overview
The purpose of this analysis is to determine which employees will be retiring soon, their positions, and who will be eligible to participate in a mentorship program. In order to obtain this data, it is necessary to filter the employee information to determine which employees have birth dates between 1952 and 1955, as well as their most recent titles. It is also necessary to avoid duplicate information, and non-unique titles. The final result of this part of the deliverable is the retiring_titles.csv file which includes columns for employee number, first name, last name, title, from date, and to date for employees born between 1952 and 1955. 

The second goal of this analysis includes creating a table which includes information regarding employees born in 1965 who are eligible to participate in a part-time mentorship program. This information is stored in mentorship_eligibility.csv and includes columns for employee number, first name, last name, birth date, from date, to date, and title.
